        <h2 style="color:#5FD3BC;">1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>With the increase in the number of readers, better management of libraries system is required. 
		The Library management system focuses on improving the management of libraries in a city or town. 
		“What If you can check whether a book is available in the library through your phone?” or 
		“what if instead of having different library cards for different libraries you can just have one?”
		or “you can reserve a book or issue a book from your phone sitting at your home!”. 
		The Integrated Library Management system provides you the ease of issuing, renewing or reserving a book from a library within your town through your phone.
		The Integrated Library Management system is developed on the android platform which basically focuses on issuing, renewing, and reserving a book.
        <h4 id="sec1.1">1.1 Purpose</h4>
        <p> The purpose of the project is to maintain the details of books and library members of different libraries. 
		The main purpose of this project is to maintain an easy circulation system between clients and the libraries, to issue books using single library member id number, also to search and borrow any book from different available libraries and to maintain details about the user (fine, address, phone number).
		Moreover, the user can check all these features from their home.
        <h4 id="sec1.2">1.2 Intended Audience</h4>
        <p> The intended audiences for this document are:<br>
        <ul type="bullet">
			<li>The team members of Innovative library Solutions. This document will be reviewed frequently by the above audiences to check if the different phases of the project are being completed by meeting the given requirements. If there are any changes in the requirements in the course of the project they must be included in this document by making the necessary changes.
		</ul>
        <h4 id="sec1.3">1.3 Intended Use</h4>
        <p> The intended audience consists of <br>
		<ul type="bullet">
		<li>Software Project Managers
		<li>Software Engineers
		<li>Software Developers
		<li>Library Organizer
		</ul>
        <h4 id="sec1.4">1.4 Product Scope</h4>
        <p> Project Title: Library Management System Prepared By: Students of North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Project Justification: This project is basically updating the manual library system into an internet based application so that the users can know the details of their account, availability of books, etc. Product Characteristics and Requirements :<br>
		<ul type="i">
		<li>Secured database
		<li>User tracking
		<li>Calculating fine
		<li>Search feature
		<li>Checking the availability of books
		<li>Students will get an E-mail before the due date in order to avoid fines. Project Management Deliverables: Project plan, Research finding report, Work breakdown structure, The scope statement, Project charter, Training manuals, lessons learned report, etc. Product-related deliverables: Research reports, design documents, software code, hardware, test plan, project benefit measurement plan, etc.
		</ul>
		<p> <b>Project Success Criteria:</b> Our main goal is to complete this project within the allotted deadline and also within the budget allotted. It is necessary to develop a method for capturing the benefits while the library management system is being developed, tested, and after it is rolled out. If the project takes a little longer to complete or costs a little more than planned, the firm will still view it as a success if it has a good payback and helps promote the firm’s image as an excellent management organization
		
        <h4 id="sec1.5">1.5 Risk Definition</h4>
         <p> There is no market risk because this is a university library management system. But there can be a risk of finding all kinds of books such as a university student needs different kinds of books, so, a lot of books should be stored in the database and for that database should be in huge size. A huge database can slow down processing. This point should be in mind while developing the system.

        <br><br><br>

        <!-- Descriptions edited -->

        <h2 style="color:#5FD3BC;">2. Overall Description</h2>
        <p><b>Product Perspective:</b><br>
		The implementation of Library Management starts with entering and updating master records like book details, library information. Any further transaction like book issue, book return will automatically update the current books. The proposed Library Management System will take care of the current book detail at any point in time. The book issue, book return will update the current book details automatically so that the user will get the updated current book details.
		Product function: The main purpose of this project is to reduce the manual work. This software is capable of managing Book Issues, Returns, and Calculating/Managing Fine. Generating various Reports for Record-Keeping according to end-user requirements.
		<br><br>This System will provide search functionality to facilitate the search for resources. This search will be based on various categories viz. book name or the ISBN. Also, an Advanced Search feature is provided in order to search for various categories simultaneously. 
        <h4 id="sec2.1">2.1 User Classes and Characteristics</h4>
        <p> <ul type="bullet">
			<li> User module: In the user module, the user will check the availability of the books.
			<li> Book return
			<li> Administration module: The following are the submodule in the administration module.
			<li> Register user
			<li> Entry book details
			<li> Book issue
		</ul>
			There are various kinds of users for the product. Usually, web products are visited by various users for different reasons.
		<ul type="bullet"> <li>	students who will be using the above features by accessing the Library online.
			<li> A librarian who will be acting as the controller and he will have all the privileges of an administrator.
		</ul>
        <h4 id="sec2.2">2.2 User Needs</h4>
        <p> The software provides a good graphical interface for the user any administrator can operate on the system, performing the required task such as create, update, viewing the details of the book.
		<ul type="bullet"> 
			<li> Allows users to view quick reports like Book Issues/Returned etc in between a particular time.
			<li> Stock verification and search facility based on different criteria.
		</ul>
		<p> The user of this product needs not be a computer expert. Even an active user can also operate the system. The user interfaces are to be made so simple that anybody can be comfortable in working with the system in just a few minutes. The basic things which are required in a user are: <br>
		<ul type="bullet"> 
			<li> Users should know what the computer is.
			<li> User should understand English
			<li> User must know which key (button or keyboard) does what
			<li> User must have experience in library management. 
		</ul>
		
		<p><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b> <br>
	The problem occurred before having computerized system includes:

	<br><br><b>File lost</b> <br>
	When a computerized system is not implemented file is always lost because of the human environment. Some times due to some human error there may be a loss of records.

	<br><br><b>File damaged</b> <br>
	When a computerized system is not their file is always lost due to some accident like spilling of water by some member on file accidentally. Besides some natural disasters like floods or fires may also damage the files.

	<br><br><b>Difficult to search record</b> <br>
	When there is no computerized system there is always a difficulty in searching of records if the records are large in number.

	<br><br><b>Space consuming</b> <br>
	After the number of records becomes large the space for physical storage of file and records also increases if no computerized system is implemented.

	<br><br><b>Cost consuming</b> <br>
	As there is no computerized system to add each recording paper will be needed which will increase the cost for the management of the library.
        <h4 id="sec2.3">2.3 Operating Environment</h4>
        <p> The product will be operating in the windows environment. Also, it will be compatible with the IE 6.0. Most of the features will be compatible with the Mozilla firefox & Opera 7.0 or higher version. The only requirement to use this online product would be an internet connection.<br>

		<br>Books and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track of the students using the library and also a detailed description of the books a library contains. With this computerized system, there will be no loss of book record or member record which generally happens when a non-computerized system is used.

        <h4 id="sec2.4">2.4 Constraints</h4>
        <p> The operating environment is given below:
        <ul type="bullet">	
		<li>The system database used should be an open-source technology.
		<li>The system should be implemented in Java Technology.
		<li>The downtime of the system should be less than 10 min.
		<li>RAM usages should not exceed 1024MB.
		<li>This system software size should not exceed 1GB.
		</ul>
		
        <h4 id="sec2.5">2.5 Assumptions</h4>
        <p> It is assumed that the optimum internet connectivity speed will be more than 512 Kbps. If the bandwidth is less than this then the transaction completion will take more time to processed and be complete. <br>

		<br>The product is designed for both the Users and Library Admin. It will be a helpful product in a very effective way as it will reduce the tiresome workload from both Users and Library Admin.
